<p> Due to the specific HTML and CSS used to justify buttons (namely display: table-cell), the borders between them are doubled. In regular button groups, margin-left: -1px is used to stack the borders instead of removing them. However, margin doesn't work with display: table-cell. As a result, depending on your customizations to Bootstrap, you may wish to remove or re-color the borders. </p>
